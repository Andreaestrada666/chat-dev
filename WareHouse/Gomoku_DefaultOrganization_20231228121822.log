        self.root.title("Gomoku")
        self.buttons = [[None for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]

        for row in range(15):
            for col in range(15):
                button = tk.Button(self.root, text=' ', width=2, height=1, command=lambda r=row, c=col: self.make_move(r, c))

            self.show_winner(winner)

    def show_winner(self, winner):
        messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", f"Player {winner} wins!")

        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    game = GomokuGame()
    gui = GomokuGUI(game)
    gui.run()
```

In this code, we have two classes: `GomokuGame` and `GomokuGUI`. The `GomokuGame` class handles the game logic, including the board state, player turns, and checking for a winner. The `GomokuGUI` class integrates the game logic with a Tkinter-based GUI, allowing players to make moves by clicking on buttons representing the board.

To run the game, execute the `main.py` file.

This is the main file that handles the game logic and GUI integration. Next, we will create a file for utility functions.

**utils.py**

```python
'''
This file contains utility functions for the Gomoku game.
'''

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(' '.join(row))
```

The `print_board` function in `utils.py` is a utility function that prints the current state of the game board.

Now, we have the main file and a utility file. We will create a separate file for the AI player.

**ai_player.py**

```python
'''
This file contains the AI player logic for the Gomoku game.
'''

import random

class AIPlayer:
    def __init__(self, game):
        self.game = game

    def make_move(self):
        empty_cells = []
        for row in range(15):
            for col in range(15):
                if self.game.board[row][col] == ' ':
                    empty_cells.append((row, col))
        if empty_cells:
            row, col = random.choice(empty_cells)
            self.game.play_move(row, col)
```

The `AIPlayer` class in `ai_player.py` represents an AI player that makes random moves on the game board.

With these files, we have implemented the basic Gomoku game in Python with a GUI. The `main.py` file handles the game logic and GUI integration, the `utils.py` file provides utility functions, and the `ai_player.py` file contains the AI player logic.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and can be further enhanced with additional features and improvements.

 To develop a basic Gomoku game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), we will need to create multiple files. Let's start with the main file, which will handle the game logic and GUI integration.

**main.py**

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter and messagebox modules in the GomokuGUI class. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Also, make sure to update the requirements.txt file to include the necessary dependencies for the tkinter module.

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to import the required modules and run without any errors.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a basic Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter and messagebox modules in the GomokuGUI class. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Also, make sure to update the requirements.txt file to include the necessary dependencies for the tkinter module.

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to import the required modules and run without any errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a basic Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes and functions used in the main.py file. Specifically, the GomokuGame class from main.py requires the tkinter module to be imported. Additionally, the AIPlayer class from ai_player.py needs to import the GomokuGame class from main.py.

To fix this issue, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py and ai_player.py files:

In main.py:
```python
from ai_player import AIPlayer
```

In ai_player.py:
```python
from main import GomokuGame
```

Once these import statements are added, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

<INFO> Please make the necessary changes and retest the code.

Comments on Codes:
" Please make the necessary changes and retest the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the required classes and modules. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from utils import print_board
from ai_player import AIPlayer
```

Also, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `ai_player.py` file:

```python
from main import GomokuGame
```

This will ensure that all the necessary classes and modules are imported and available for use in the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
