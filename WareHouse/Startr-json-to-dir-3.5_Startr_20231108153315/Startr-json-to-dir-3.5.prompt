Python script:

Read the JSON file: The script will begin by opening and reading the JSON file provided as input.

Parse the JSON content: It will then parse the content of the JSON file into a Python dictionary.

Create directories and Markdown files based on the JSON structure:

For each key-value pair in the dictionary:
If the value is a primitive data type (e.g., string, number, boolean), the script will create a Markdown file named after the key and write the value as the content of the file.
If the value is an object, the script will create a directory named after the key. It will then recursively process the object, creating subdirectories and files following the same logic.
If the value is an array, the script will create a Markdown file named after the key. The array items will be written into the file as a list in Markdown syntax.
Handle special characters in keys: The script will sanitize keys to remove or replace characters that are not allowed in file or directory names.

Handle empty values:

For empty objects, an empty directory will be created.
For empty arrays, a Markdown file will be created with the key's name, but it will contain no list items.
Output confirmation: Once the script finishes running, it will output a message indicating the completion of the task and provide the path to the root directory of the created structure.

Error Handling: The script will include basic error handling to manage issues such as read/write permissions, invalid JSON formats, and other potential file system errors.

Do you confirm this is the intended functionality? If so, I will proceed with creating the Python script.
