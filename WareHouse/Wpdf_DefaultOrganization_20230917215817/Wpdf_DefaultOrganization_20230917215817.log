Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter and messagebox modules in the main.py file. These modules are required for the GUI functionality and displaying message boxes. 

To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Once you add this import statement, the code should be able to use the `tk.messagebox` functions without any errors.

Additionally, it would be a good practice to add comments to the methods in the converter.py file to explain their functionality and parameters. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers who might work on it in the future.

Once you make these changes, the code should be ready for execution.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the tkinter and messagebox modules in the main.py file. These modules are required for the GUI functionality and displaying message boxes. 

To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

Once you add this import statement, the code should be able to use the `tk.messagebox` functions without any errors.

Additionally, it would be a good practice to add comments to the methods in the converter.py file to explain their functionality and parameters. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers who might work on it in the future.

Once you make these changes, the code should be ready for execution."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Convert PDF file into docx format provided by user.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the `tkinter` and `PyPDF2` modules. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` and `converter.py` files:

In `main.py`:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from tkinter import messagebox
```

In `converter.py`:
```python
from docx import Document
import PyPDF2
```

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the `Application` class in `main.py` to explain their functionality. For example, you can add comments like this:

```python
def select_pdf(self):
    """
    Opens a file dialog to select a PDF file.
    """
    self.file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("PDF Files", "*.pdf")])

def convert_pdf_to_docx(self):
    """
    Converts the selected PDF file to DOCX format using the Converter class.
    """
    if self.file_path:
        self.converter.convert(self.file_path)
        messagebox.showinfo("Conversion Complete", "PDF converted to DOCX successfully!")
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select a PDF file.")
```

Once you make these changes, the code should be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the `tkinter` and `PyPDF2` modules. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` and `converter.py` files:

In `main.py`:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from tkinter import messagebox
```

In `converter.py`:
```python
from docx import Document
import PyPDF2
```

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the `Application` class in `main.py` to explain their functionality. For example, you can add comments like this:

```python
def select_pdf(self):
    """
    Opens a file dialog to select a PDF file.
    """
    self.file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("PDF Files", "*.pdf")])

def convert_pdf_to_docx(self):
    """
    Converts the selected PDF file to DOCX format using the Converter class.
    """
    if self.file_path:
        self.converter.convert(self.file_path)
        messagebox.showinfo("Conversion Complete", "PDF converted to DOCX successfully!")
    else:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select a PDF file.")
```

Once you make these changes, the code should be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Convert PDF file into docx format provided by user.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes and modules it is using. Specifically, the `Converter` class in `converter.py` is using the `Document` class from the `docx` module and the `PdfReader` class from the `PyPDF2` module, but these imports are not present in the code.

To fix this issue, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the respective files:

In `converter.py`:
```python
from docx import Document
import PyPDF2
```

With these import statements added, the code will be able to access the required classes and modules, and the PDF to DOCX conversion functionality should work as expected.

Please make this modification to ensure that the code can run without any import errors.

    def convert(self, pdf_path):
        doc = Document()
        pdf_file = open(pdf_path, 'rb')
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
        for page_num in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
            page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
            doc.add_paragraph(page.extract_text())
        doc.save(pdf_path.replace(".pdf", ".docx"))
```

Comments on Codes:
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the classes and modules it is using. Specifically, the `Converter` class in `converter.py` is using the `Document` class from the `docx` module and the `PdfReader` class from the `PyPDF2` module, but these imports are not present in the code.

To fix this issue, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the respective files:

In `converter.py`:
```python
from docx import Document
import PyPDF2
```

With these import statements added, the code will be able to access the required classes and modules, and the PDF to DOCX conversion functionality should work as expected.

Please make this modification to ensure that the code can run without any import errors.
