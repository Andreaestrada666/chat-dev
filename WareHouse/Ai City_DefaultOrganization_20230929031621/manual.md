# Stone Age City Simulation User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stone Age City Simulation! This software allows you to create and simulate a stone age city with AI agents. The agents can reproduce and advance, and the simulation also includes a graphical user interface (UI) for visualization.

## Installation

To use the Stone Age City Simulation, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can follow these steps to set up the simulation:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stone-age-city-simulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stone-age-city-simulation`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stone-age-city-simulation`
3. Run the main.py file: `python main.py`

The simulation will start, and you will see the stone age city and the AI agents in the UI window. The agents will reproduce and advance over time.

## Customization

If you want to customize the simulation, you can modify the code in the following files:

- `main.py`: This is the main file that runs the simulation. You can change the number of AI agents created and modify the simulation settings.
- `city.py`: This file contains the City class, which represents the stone age city. You can add more functionality to the city or modify its behavior.
- `agent.py`: This file contains the Agent class, which represents the AI agents in the city. You can add more attributes or methods to the agents.
- `ui.py`: This file contains the UI class, which represents the graphical user interface for the simulation. You can modify the UI layout or add more visual elements.

Feel free to experiment and customize the simulation according to your needs!
