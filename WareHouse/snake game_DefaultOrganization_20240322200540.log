**task_prompt**: A game where you control a pixelated snake on a rectangular grid and guide it to eat food (represented by dots). As the snake consumes the food, it grows longer, making the game progressively challenging. The game's pace gradually increases, making it more difficult to manoeuvre the snake without running into obstacles. With each successful consumption of food, the player earns points, and the game continues until the snake collides with itself or the boundaries
