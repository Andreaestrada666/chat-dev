        "PARAGRAPH = \"The Android Application for Turkey country and Sustainable Food Waste Management is a project developed by Terraformation, a startup company with a mission to create an international environmental governance. The company envisions a world where sustainability is at the forefront of all economic activities, and where waste is managed in a responsible and efficient manner.  The problem that Terraformation aims to solve is the growing issue of food waste. In Turkey, it is estimated that 19 million tons of food is wasted each year, which not only has a significant impact on the environment but also on the economy and society. This waste also contributes to global warming, as it produces methane gas when it decomposes in landfills.  The Android application developed by Terraformation aims to tackle this problem by providing a platform for individuals and businesses to easily and efficiently manage their food waste. The app will connect users with compost collection services, similar to how Uber connects users with transportation services. This will not only help reduce food waste but also promote sustainable practices and create a circular economy.  The ultimate goal of Terraformation is to create a global network of sustainable food waste management, where individuals and businesses can easily access compost collection services and contribute to a more sustainable future. By leveraging technology and innovation, Terraformation aims to make a positive impact on the environment and society.\" # @param {type:\"string\"}\n",

Run the code on a machine with a graphical display: If you are running the code on a headless server or a remote SSH session, try running it on a machine with a graphical display.\\n2. Use a virtual display: If running the code on a machine with a graphical display is not possible, you can use a virtual display, such as Xvfb, to create a virtual display environment for the code to run.\\n3. Modify the code to handle headless execution: You can modify the code to handle headless execution by checking if a display is available before creating the Tkinter window. If no display is available, you can skip creating the window or use a different approach to interact with the application.\\n\\nPlease note that the specific solution depends on your requirements and the environment in which you intend to run the code.\"} |\n",

Tkinter requires a display to create and interact with GUI elements.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\\n\\n1. Run the application on a machine with a graphical interface: If you are running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment, you may need to run the code on a machine with a graphical interface, such as your local computer or a virtual machine with a desktop environment.\\n\\n2. Use a virtual display: If running the code on a machine with a graphical interface is not feasible, you can use a virtual display, such as Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer), to create a virtual display for the application to use. This allows you to run the code in a headless environment while still providing a display for Tkinter.\\n\\n3. Modify the code to remove the GUI dependency: If a GUI is not necessary for your application, you can modify the code to remove the GUI elements and run it in a headless environment. This may involve removing the Tkinter-related code and finding alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the specific solution depends on your requirements and the intended use of the application.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |\n",
